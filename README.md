# End to End SF311 Data Pipeline

# Dataset
The dataset chosen for my data engineering project is derived from [SF311](https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/311-Cases/vw6y-z8j6), a municipal service formally established by the City and County of San Francisco. SF311 serves as a pivotal communications channel, seamlessly connecting residents, businesses, and visitors with a dedicated team of Customer Service Representatives. This service plays a fundamental role in facilitating a wide spectrum of government-related inquiries and services, making it an indispensable resource for our project's objectives.

# Technologies and Tools
For this project I decided to use the following tools:
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
- Workflow orchestration: Airflow
- VM instance to run the whole data pipeline: Google Compute Engine
- Data Lake: Google Cloud Storage
- Data Warehouse: Google BigQuery
- Data Transformation: DBT
- Data Visualization: Google Looker Studio
